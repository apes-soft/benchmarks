Advanced Potential Energy Surface (APES) benchmarks
===================================================

This repository was set up to store and share a set of benchmarks deemed useful for measuring the performance of computational chemistry packages relevant to the APES project.

The top-level INDEX file contains a list of short descriptions of the benchmarks. Each benchmark lives in its own consecutively numbered directory labeled "bench##". Within each bench directory, subdirectories labeled according to software packages (e.g. TINKER, PMEMD, etc.) should contain the input files needed to run the benchmark using the relevant locally built executable(s) of the package whose performance is being measured.
