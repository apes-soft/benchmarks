bench01: JAC Model
==================

To run this benchmark you must ensure that:

1. The `jac.xyz` data file.
2. The `dynamic` executable from the Tinker distribution is in your path or you must modify the `tinker/jac.sh` script to have the path to the `dynamic` executable hard wired.
3. Go into the `tinker` subdirectory and you should be able to run the script `./jac.sh`.
