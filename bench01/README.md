bench01: JAC Model
==================

To run this benchmark you must ensure that:

1. The .xyz file has been uncompressed (it is in the jac.zip file).
2. The dynamic executable from the Tinker distribution is in your path or you must modify the tinker/jac.sh script to have the path to the dynamic executable hard wired.
